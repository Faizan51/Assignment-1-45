//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. 
//Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a 
//value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. 
//If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

//• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and
// another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

let alienColour:"green"|"yelllow"|"red"="green"

if (alienColour==="green"){

    console.log("Player Just earned 5 points")
}


// let alienColour:"green"|"yelllow"|"red"="blue"

// if (alienColour==="green"){

//     console.log("Player Just earned 5 points")
// }

//The Above program shows and error and not run due to type Literals

//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should
//  always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number 
//  of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
//  such as a color or an optional feature.
//  Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
//Code Solution
let carInformation = (manufacturer, modelName, color, gear) => {
    let carObject = { manufacturer, modelName, color, gear };
    return carObject;
};
console.log(carInformation("Totota", "Yaris", "Gray", "Auto"));
console.log(carInformation("Totota", "Yaris", "Gray"));
console.log(carInformation("Totota", "Yaris"));
export {};

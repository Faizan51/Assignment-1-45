// Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, 
//and write
// an if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just 
//earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that 
//the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block 
//and another that runs the else block.
//Code Solution
let alienColour = "green";
if (alienColour === "green") {
    console.log("Player Just earned 5 points");
